          Another way of relaxation for me is cooking various dishes. The hero
          of the TV series Hannibal inspired me to learn culinary masterpieces.
          I was fascinated by how carefully and with what tenderness he prepared
          the products before cooking. How he put his soul into them and,
          naturally, how he organized dinner parties for his friends.
          Undoubtedly, the role model is not the best, but who wouldn't want to
          come to visit friends and see a truly royal table decoration, a
          variety of dishes and atmosphere. But I didn't stop there. To begin
          with, I turned my eyes to the most famous chef of our time - Gordon
          Ramsay. His dishes are simple, but they look very appetizing.
          Therefore, for the most part I learned from his books, TV series and
          blog.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm h-100" align="justify">
          At any convenient time, I am engaged in some dish in the kitchen. It
          is my desire to learn how to cook delicious and varied food for my
          loved ones. Collecting various recipes, I definitely try them, improve
          them, remove excess and write them down in order to make a book of my
          own recipes at the end.
          <p>
            Once I managed to get acquainted with the sous chef of a restaurant,
            and I asked him to teach me. He agreed and invited me to practice
            straight into the kitchen. It was an unforgettable experience. Since
            the kitchen was right in the hall, I cooked under his supervision
            right with the audience, who were waiting for their dishes. But I
            don't like the fact that now most restaurants don't cook from under
            the knife.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm h-100" align="justify">
          The blanks are prepared in advance and are already served warmed up
          and with all the ingredients. This is undoubtedly a cost saving for
          the restaurant, but you will never know how long the pasta has been
          frozen.
          <p>
            After such practice, I began to try new ones at home on my own. I
            began to understand kitchen utensils: knives, frying pans,
            saucepans. I also learned to distinguish the freshness of products,
            this is a very important point in cooking. And most importantly – I
            have understood the real secret of chefs and I am ready to share it
            with you. The most important ingredient in any dish that a real chef
            makes is the desire to see a real smile of the customer's joy from
            the prepared dish. The customer's praise is the real coin that every
            cook is waiting for. For me – the smile of loved ones.

          But this is not just a secret of chefs. This is the secret of any
          undertaking – so that the final product is pleasant to the user, and
          he is happy to use it. That's why I trained as a testing engineer,
          because this is an important role in the production of applications.
          It is the testers who polish the application with all their love,
          hoping that the user will be satisfied with the application.
