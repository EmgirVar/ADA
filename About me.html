              I graduated from Ivanovo State University of Chemical Technology
              in 2016 with a degree in Economics. After that, he got a job at a
              bank, as a "Document verification specialist". Thanks to this job,
              I have honed my business communication skills, both in telephone
              negotiations and in correspondence. I also gained the discipline
              skill, which helps me now to organize my daily routine and not
              forget about important things. The notes in the calendar remind me
              of the plans. Even if there are a lot of them, I can distribute
              the load and prioritize correctly.

          At the beginning of this year, he completed courses from Yandex Practicum 
          with the qualification of "Testing Engineer". With the help of the acquired 
          knowledge, I learned to describe my plans in more detail, make daily 
          checklists and look at things more deeply. During his studies, he took part 
          in testing Yandex applications, namely the Metro and, at that time, a 
          Scooter in development. I independently compiled and maintained test 
          documentation: checklists, test cases. I described and tracked all the bugs 
          found in the Yandex Tracker dashboard.

            The Yandex Metro application was tested for cross-browser, modular and 
            functional. At that time, Yandex Scooter had to be tested deeper. In 
            addition to testing the web application for modular, cross-browser, 
            functional, usabillity, there was also an application for couriers on
             mobile devices, namely on android. It was tested through the Android 
             Virtual Device emulator. The application api was also tested and the 
             behavior in the database was monitored using sql queries.  
            After completing the course, I did an internship at a company that was 
            developing web and mobile applications for the Far East. The internship
             was excellent, but I didn't get into the team. 
            At the moment, I am expanding my knowledge and studying at the front-end
             of the developer.
